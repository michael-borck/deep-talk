# Quick Start

The speed-run version of getting productive with DeepTalk. If you've already read [First Use](first-use.md), skip straight to Step 1.

**Time needed:** about 10 minutes, most of which is waiting for the first model download.

## Step 1 — Pick a transcription model

Open **Settings → Transcription**. Three choices:

| Model | Size | When to pick |
|---|---|---|
| **Tiny (English)** | ~75 MB | Default. Fastest. Fine for most recordings. |
| **Base (English)** | ~140 MB | Recommended balance of speed and accuracy. |
| **Small (English)** | ~470 MB | Best accuracy. Pick on a fast machine. |

Click **Download model now** to pre-fetch it, or just move on — DeepTalk will download it the first time you hit Transcribe.

## Step 2 — Point DeepTalk at an LLM

Open **Settings → Processing → AI Analysis Service**. Everything after transcription (summary, themes, action items, chat) needs a language model.

- **Stay private** — install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and run `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`. Leave the provider set to Ollama. Nothing leaves your machine.
- **Want more power** — switch to OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, OpenRouter, or a custom endpoint. Paste the API key. A "☁ Cloud" banner reminds you transcripts will be sent to that provider.

Click **Test Connection**, then **Refresh Models** and pick one. That's it.

## Step 3 — Upload a file

Click **Upload & Process** in the sidebar. Drag an audio or video file into the dropzone (MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, MP4, MOV, WebM, FLAC — most formats work). Optionally assign it to a project. Click **Upload & Process**.

DeepTalk will:

1. Decode the audio
2. Transcribe with Whisper (local)
3. Detect speakers from audio with pyannote + wespeaker (local, if enabled)
4. Run AI analysis for summary, themes, sentiment, action items
5. Save everything to the Library

You can navigate away — processing continues in the background. A toast tells you when it's done.

## Step 4 — Read the results

Click the transcript in the **Library**. The detail page has:

- **Overview** — summary, key topics, action items, sentiment, notable quotes
- **Transcript** — the full text with speaker tags and timestamps; click a line to jump the audio player to that point
- **Analysis** — deeper research views (themes, Q&A pairs, concept frequency, speaker talk-time)
- **Chat** — ask questions about the content

If you need to rename speakers or fix diarisation mistakes, open **Speaker Tagging** from the transcript detail page.

## Step 5 — Organise with projects

Projects let you analyse multiple recordings together.

1. Sidebar → **Projects** → **New Project**
2. Give it a name, optional description, colour, icon
3. Open the project and click **Add Transcripts** to include recordings from the Library
4. Use the project's **Insights**, **Cross-transcript Search**, and **Chat** tabs to work across the whole set

A project's chat has access to every transcript in the project at once — good for questions like "which interviews mentioned the Q3 roadmap?".

## Step 6 — Export

From any transcript detail page, click **Export** to save as Markdown, TXT, JSON, or PDF. Projects have their own export with multi-transcript analysis bundled in.

## Tips

- **Start with short files** while you're learning. A 2-minute recording gives you the full workflow in under a minute of processing on an M-series Mac.
- **Defaults are sensible.** Tiny.en + Ollama + speaker detection is a reasonable starting point for most users.
- **Settings save immediately.** No Save button.
- **Press `Cmd/Ctrl + ?`** anytime for the full keyboard shortcuts list.
